Questions:

1. Why is it better to calculate the gradient (slope) directly rather than numerically?

answer:
It is computationally expensive to go back through the entire neural network and adjust the weights for each layer of the neural network.

2. What are the main neural network components that make up a Long Short Term Memory network?

answer:
Prediction, ignoring, forgetting, and selection.

3. How should you assign weights to input neurons before training your network for the first time?

answer:
Completely randomly.

4. When are Convolutional Neural Networks not useful?

answer:
If your data can't be made to look like an image, or if you can rearrange elements of your data and it's still just as useful.
