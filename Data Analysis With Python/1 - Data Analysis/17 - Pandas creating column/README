# What code would add a "Certificates per month" column to the certificates_earned DataFrame like the one below?

#       Certificates  Time (in months)  Certificates per month
# Tom               8                16                    0.50
# Kris              2                 5                    0.40
# Ahmad             5                 9                    0.56
# Beau              6                12                    0.50

# Answer:
# certificates_earned['Certificates per month'] = round(
#     certificates_earned['Certificates'] /
#     certificates_earned['Time (in months)'], 2
# )
